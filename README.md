## Dataset

Ford GoBike System Dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system in **San Francisco Bay area in February, 2019**. The data set has been stored as a csv file, it has **16 fields and 183412 entries.**

The fields are:
 >  - User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
 >  - Bike ID
 >  - Member's Birth Year
 >  - Member's Gender
 >  - Ride Start Time
 >  - Trip Duration in seconds
 >  - Ride End Time
 >  - Start Station ID
 >  - Start Station Name
 >  - Start Station Latitude
 >  - Start Station Longitude
 >  - End Station ID
 >  - End Station Name
 >  - End Station Latitude
 >  - End Station Longitude


## Summary of Findings

Some assumptions were made about the dataset. Every trip from start to end was taken with anonymosity, so total distance of each trip was calculated using the start station longitude and latitude and the end station longitude and latitude.

The following observations were made:
 > - Most of the rides were short duration rides (**less than 40,000** seconds)
 > - Most of the rides are by the Subscribers.
 > - Most of the rides were taken on weekdays excluding weekends.
 > - Most of the rides were **less than 10km** long.



## Key Insights for Presentation

> Most trips were made during the weekdays compared to weekends. Subscribers tend to take more rides as compared to customer users. Subscribers are **approximately 90%** of total users of Ford GoBike while Customers are just **approximately 10%**. 
Most of the users are also male with a population of **116,263**, followed by the female gender. Also most of the users are within the age of **20-45 year old** and most trips were made on **Thursdays**
